_Effective_: April 8, 2024

Thank you for using Wanna Match!

By downloading and using Wanna Match, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these policies, you must immediately stop using Wanna Match services and uninstall the application from your devices.

Wanna Match is committed to ensuring your privacy is protected. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect and use your personal information when you use our mobile application.

## Information Collection and Use

This app will ask you to enter your first name with last name optional to get started. The chosen name, which may also be a preferred nickname, will be prominently displayed on the home screen. Subsequently, you will be prompted to complete a questionnaire relating to your relationship preferences. All data collected by Wanna Match serves exclusively for the purpose of our matching algorithm and the generation of encrypted QR codes.

## Sharing of Information

We want to assure you that Wanna Match does not track any information remotely. Your usage data, interactions, and any other activities within the app remain entirely local to your device and are not transmitted to any servers or shared with third parties. All entered data are deleted when Wanna Match is removed from the device. We prioritize your privacy and strive to maintain transparency in our data practices.

## Scanning QR Code

The QR code generated by Wanna Match encapsulates encrypted information entered by its users. When you voluntarily display your Wanna Match QR code in any form for scanning by others, you are consenting to the decryption of this information by Wanna Match on another device. If used solely for the purpose of integrating it into the matching algorithm, the decrypted information is promptly purged from the other device following the matching process. However, if you permit another user to scan your QR code for the purpose of adding you as a friend, you are consenting to the storage of your Wanna Match data on their device, thereby agreeing to the display of your QR code on the detailed friends screen.

## Camera Usage and Permission Consent

We respect your privacy and understand the sensitivity surrounding the use of cameras. Before accessing your device's camera, Wanna Match will request explicit permission from you. You have the option to grant or deny access to the camera within your device's settings. Any data captured or accessed by the camera within Wanna Match is solely used for scanning QR codes, and no image or video data is saved by the app. Camera data is not shared with any third parties.

## Friend Photos

Wanna Match does not possess direct access to your photo album or library, and as such, do not require or manage permissions related to your privacy settings. Only the photos you willingly grant access to Wanna Match are displayed within the app. Wanna Match does not retain the capability to modify or distribute any photos utilized within the application.

## No Children Allowed

Our app is not directed to individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you become aware that your child is using Wanna Match, please uninstall the app from their device(s). This will remove any and all information entered while using Wanna Match.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the date of the last update will be indicated at the top of the policy.
